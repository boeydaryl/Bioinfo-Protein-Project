Diary week 1

2018 19 Feb

Personal assigned project is to predict if, given an amino acid sequence, if the state is buried or exposed. The dataset assigned was "buried-exposed", and it's a 3 line file (header/title, AA sequence, and assigned states).

The overall motive of the project is to write a program that, given an amino acid sequence, can predict the states like in the assigned dataset file. The dataset is to be used to train the program to do this.

Wrote a simple 3 line parser to format the dataset; first into a dictionary, followed by a pandas dataframe to allow for faster retrieval of data.

Attended project introduction session, more about the project requirements was mentioned.
Basic requirements:
Extract the feature from your dataset
Create cross-validated sets
Train a SVM using single sequence information, using sklearn
Check different window sizes for the inputs
Analyze the results and compare it to previous work
Review the state of art for your predictor
Write a report

Additional requirements:
Add evolutionary information by running psi-blast and extracting the information
Train a SVM using multiple sequence information
Optimize the performance of the SVM
Use random forests and a simple decision tree and compare the performance with the SVM performance.
Extract the data from 50 other proteins and test the performance.

As such, the plan for week 1 is to establish a solid project framework/guideline, as well as read up on a minimum of 5 relevant publications related to the prediction of buried/exposed states, as well as to make a couple of tries at prediction model using Scikit-learn.

Interesting additional reading to get more specifics about Machine-Learning (https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-tribe/).
