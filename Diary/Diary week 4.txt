Diary week 4

2018 12 Mar

Model is optimised, and F1_score recorded, to consider taking a few more scores to compare the cross-validation before after optimisation.

Final code due on Friday; the readme is supposed to have clear instructions as to how to run the scripts. Important to have finished all the tasks in stated in the website to earn a grade of 'C' or higher.

Remaining tasks:

Add evolutionary information by running psi-blast and extracting the information
Use simple decision tree and compare the performance with the SVM performance.
Extract the data from 50 other proteins (new sequences with topologies! from PDB?) and test the performance (validate predicted against true topology). Source of dataset->old publications.

To improve code by allowing input via the command line instead of hard coding it in the python script.

Calculate comparison for MattCorr between new and old models.

Wrote a simple python script FASTAParser.py to parse the dataset into individual FASTA files per sequence, as preparation for input to PSI-BLAST. Wrote a bash script PSSMBash.sh to iterate through all FASTA text files in the previously parsed FASTA directory to run a PSI-BLAST (e-value=0.01, iterations=3) to output to an ASCII format .pssm file for each sequence, using the SWISSPROT database.
