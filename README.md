# Bioinfo-Protein-Project

#This github repository will serve as the single container for the Bioinformatics Project, and will be partitioned in multiple folders for cleaner project organisation. It will contain Projects (all the individual project scripts), Datasets (all the raw data), General Scripts (commonly used scripts that will be cross-project), and Bin (small scripts).
