# Bioinfo-Protein-Project

#This github repository will serve as the single container for the Bioinformatics Project, and will be partitioned in multiple folders for cleaner project organisation. It will contain Projects (all the individual project scripts), Datasets (all the raw data), General Scripts (commonly used scripts that will be cross-project), and Bin (small scripts). 

#This repository now hosts an prediction script called SVMPredictor.py, which takes FASTA format files and returns a prediction based on a trained model. The model was trained using a dataset of 50 proteins from the buried-exposed.3line.txt dataset. An example FASTA file to test the predictor with is 5W0P_A.FASTA.txt, located in the Datasets folder. The predictor has been configured by default to run this test file.
